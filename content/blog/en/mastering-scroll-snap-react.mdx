Scroll snapping can significantly enhance the user experience of landing pages and portfolios. It provides a tactile, app-like feel that guides the user through your content one section at a time.

## CSS Scroll Snap Basics

The core of the technique relies on CSS properties. `scroll-snap-type` on the container and `scroll-snap-align` on the children. But getting it to feel "just right" requires a bit more finesse.

```css
.container {
  overflow-y: scroll;
  scroll-snap-type: y mandatory;
}

.section {
  scroll-snap-align: start;
  height: 100vh;
}
```

While this works for basic cases, handling dynamic content heights and ensuring accessibility requires careful consideration.

## Integrating with React

In React, we can enhance this behavior with hooks to track the active section, trigger animations, or pre-fetch content as the user scrolls. Using `IntersectionObserver` is key here.

```jsx
import { useEffect, useRef, useState } from "react";

function useActiveSection(sectionRefs) {
  const [activeIndex, setActiveIndex] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const observer = new IntersectionObserver(
      (entries) => {
        entries.forEach((entry) => {
          if (entry.isIntersecting) {
            const index = sectionRefs.current.indexOf(entry.target);
            setActiveIndex(index);
          }
        });
      },
      { threshold: 0.5 }
    );

    sectionRefs.current.forEach((ref) => observer.observe(ref));
    return () => observer.disconnect();
  }, [sectionRefs]);

  return activeIndex;
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always test on mobile** - Touch scrolling behaves differently
2. **Consider accessibility** - Provide skip navigation for keyboard users
3. **Performance matters** - Debounce scroll handlers appropriately
4. **Fallback gracefully** - Not all browsers support scroll snap perfectly
